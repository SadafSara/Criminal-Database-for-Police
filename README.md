# Criminal-Database-for-Police
This project is built using MySQL, PHP, HTML and CSS. Using this web application, the police department would be able to:
* enter the type of crime and see a table of records according to the entered crime type
* enter a date and see a table of records of all the crimes lodged on that date
* create a new column (to add further information about a user such as their mobile number, address, image etc.) in the datatable of the USERS
